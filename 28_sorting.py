"""
Task 1
A bubble sort can be modified to "bubble" in both directions. The first pass moves "up" the list and the second pass moves "down."
This alternating pattern continues until no more passes are necessary. 
Implement this variation and describe under what circumstances it might be appropriate.""" 

"""
Task 2. Implement the mergeSort function without using the slice operator."""

"""
Task 3. One way to improve the quicksort is to use an insertion sort on lists that are small in length (call it the "partition limit"). 
Why does this make sense? Re-implement the quicksort and use it to sort a random list of integers. 
Perform analysis using different list sizes for the partition limit."""
